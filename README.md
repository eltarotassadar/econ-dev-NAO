# Modeling of natural processes in the zones of economic development of the Nenets Autonomous Okrug (Diploma)

At present, the development of the economy of the Bolshezemelskaya tundra (BZT) is primarily associated with the development of raw materials. However, its industrial development, as well as the entire permafrost zone, which occupies 65% of the territory of Russia, creates a number of geoecological problems, which are often exacerbated by the peculiarities of the northern nature.

  In this regard, the study of the modern dynamics of thermokarst processes, their speed and direction of development seems to be one of the most significant tasks, the solution of which can ensure the adoption of optimal and economically sound engineering solutions today when designing economic facilities and oil and gas infrastructure in the northern regions of the country.
  
  Given the significant areas occupied by permafrost and the potential danger of various kinds of problems of a permafrost-environmental nature arising within them, the involvement of spatial analysis methods for their study, including those based on the use of GIS technologies and remote sensing materials (ERS), may turn out to be very efficient.
